# planimeter
Javascript and SVG planimeter emulation.

Three rectangles and one circle are drawn so that you can trace them. The large rectangle is 37,500 square units, the two smaller
rectangles are 20,000 square units each and the circle is 31,416 square units.
The areas calculated by tracing are reasonably close.

Position the Pole (drag it with the mouse) so that the tracer can reach all the points in the figure you want to measure.
Carefully position the tracer on the edge of the figure and zero the area by pressing z, Z or 0.
Then carefully trace the figure clockwise, returning to your start point.

You can drag the tracer with the mouse or you can use the arrow keys to move 1 pixel at a time horizontally or vertically.
Hold the shift key down when you press the arrow keys to move 10 pixels at a time. This is much less accurate.

Currently, you can only set the tracer arm length by editing the code.
