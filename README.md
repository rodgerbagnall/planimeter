# planimeter
Javascript and SVG planimeter emulation.

A few rectangles and a circle are drawn so that you can trace them. Their areas in square pixels are 37,500, 20,000 and 31,416.

Position the Pole conveniently, position the tracer on the figure (zero the area by pressing z, Z or 0) and then trace the figure with the tracer, clockwise.

The areas calculated by tracing are slightly high, by about 0.3%. .

You can move the tracer using the arrow keys, 1 px at a time. Hold the shift key down to move 10 px at a time. Moving 10 px at a time is less accurate.

Currently, you only set the tracer arm length in the code.
